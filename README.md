# OpenCBM VC1520 plotter library for Python 

This is a Python wrapper around opencbm. I wrote this to be able to talk to my VC1520 plotter.

The wrapper is incomplete, but a VC1520 class is available that allows you talk on higher level to the plotter with command like:

  * move
  * draw
  * move_relative
  * draw_relative
  * puts
  * home
  * color
  * ...

Some experiments are available, have a look, do something with them.

## Install

I'm on OSX and use brew, so I installed opencbm via brew.

## Dependencies

  * Working VC1520 plotter
  * xum1541 usb to IEC adapter
  * Fun

Cheers,
Johan
